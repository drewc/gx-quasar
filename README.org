#+TITLE: Gerbil eXtended Quasar (gx-quasar)

Gerbil eXtended Quasar! A combination of [[https://cons.io][Gerbil Scheme]] with [[https://quasar.dev][Quasar]].

Javascript was actually developed based on scheme and prototyped in Common Lisp.
I love Lisp and have tried many browser implementations to try alongside my
server use. This is the first time it is working really well!

The most recent "production" build is right here: https://drewc.github.io/gx-quasar/

* Installing

We need yarn.
   : yarn --version => 1.22.5

Now clone the repo.

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:drewc/gx-quasar.git
#+end_src

Install and build all the dependencies.
#+begin_src shell
cd gx-quasar; yarn
#+end_src

Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

#+begin_src shell
quasar dev
#+end_src

* Build the app for production

The recent production build for an SPAis in the ~gh-pages~ branch.

To build it yourself, build it... yourself!

#+begin_src shell
quasar build
#+end_src
