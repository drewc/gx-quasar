While developing *GxQuasar* I do so literately[fn:lp]. Often my logs contain the
source code and regardless, in and of themselves, they are useful to all.

If you find aaanything amiss make sure to [[https://github.com/drewc/gx-quasar/issues][let me know]].

The first is actually numbered 0, but since lists seem to start at one, it is
also [[file:0000_Getting-Started.org][unlisted]], titled *gx-quasar->GxQuasar: a simple idea to Gerbilize
Javascript*. Of important note is [[file:0000_Getting-Started.org::#thirdreinit][Third Attempt: re-init registry]], where I begin
to figure out *Gambit*'s module registry in *JavaScript*.

 1) [[file:0001_Make-It-Useful.org][Make It Useful: Lazy, Links and Publish]].

    I start to lazy-load things and make a [[file:0001_Make-It-Useful.org::#plist->jso][plist->jso]] that's quite useful.

 2) [[file:0002_Lazy-Dynamic-Module-Init.org][Lazy Load, Dynamic modules, initialized]].

    This is where I finally figure out how to bypass, or use the way it was
    intended, the [[file:0002_Lazy-Dynamic-Module-Init.org::#RegisterJumpOnTrampoline][~g_module_register~]]. In particular I made a
    ~g_module_init(...)~ function. Now I can load anything at will, including
    the entire gambit runtime.

    Also of interest is the first *Vue.js* component created [[file:0002_Lazy-Dynamic-Module-Init.org::#FirstVueGx][entirely in gerbil]].


* Notes

This is just the very start but already has me very excited. Gerbil in/on the
browser!

Just the kernel runtime? http://gambitscheme.org/wiki/index.php/GambitNds
